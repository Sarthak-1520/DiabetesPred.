In this endeavor, we embark on a journey to harness the power of data and predictive modeling to tackle a crucial healthcare challenge: diabetes prediction. Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder, affects millions of individuals\n","worldwide. Early detection and intervention are paramount to managing this condition effectively.\n","\n","This project centers around the idea of utilizing machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on a set of input features. By analyzing relevant medical data and building a predictive model, we aim to create a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases of diabetes early
